Turn the heat back on low and place the chicken pieces in the pot. Sprinkle the remaining salt on the chicken, cover, and cook for about 30 minutes. Check every few minutes to see whether it needs more water, and add a bit if it does.\n5. Remove the lid, add the sliced peppers, and cook for a further ten minutes.\n6. In a small bowl, mix the sour cream, flour, and heavy cream.\n7. Remove the pieces of chicken and place the pieces on a serving platter.\n8. Add the sour cream mixture to the paprika sauce and stir until blended. Cook for a minute or two, but don’t let the sauce come to a boil. Pour the paprika sauce over the chicken pieces. Garnish with a spoonful of sour cream, if desired, and sprinkle with paprika.",
